<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Fang Bin, and I specialize in Computer Science and Technology. I pursued my undergraduate studies in this field at Xi'an Jiaotong University from August 2018 to July 2022. Following this, I embarked on a Master's program in Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervision of Professor Mali Zhuang, from September 2022 to March 2025. Since March 2025, I have been engaged in applied research on game AI at Tencent in Shenzhen.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have explored various domains, including traditional machine learning, multimodal image fusion, AI for Science (AI4Science), deep security (encompassing adversarial attacks, data poisoning, membership inference attacks and defenses, and data privacy protection), reinforcement learning, and AI-generated content (AIGC). My primary focus is on deep security, and I am currently an emerging researcher in the field of reinforcement learning.
